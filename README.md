# Plotly_deployment
A repo to deploy a dashboard via my GitHub Page of Bellybutton Biodiversity data visualization.



# About this project

## Purpose: Build an interactive data visualization for the web.

In this project, I used Javascript's Plotly library to create three basic plots: **horizontal bar chart, gauge chart, and bubble chart**. I have used D3.json to fetch external data and Javascript functional programming to manipulate the data. I have added event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. Charts are built once a user selects a sample ID number from the drop-down menu options. Finally, I have been able to deploy the interactive chart via GitHub Pages.
